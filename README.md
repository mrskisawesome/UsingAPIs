# UsingAPIs
 retrieving data from an API and displaying it on the page. Most websites with comments, reviews, or user generated social content will use APIs to store and retrieve that content - usually from a database on a distant computer, perhaps on the other side of the world.
My plan was originally to display a list of Gin Cocktails from an api
Then I was challenged to also add images from the same api, which I did and was great for letting me practice flexbox
I have stored the drink IDs in an array and am now planning how to import data from another api, from the same general source, so that i can get instructions for how to make the cocktail by using the drink ID - watch this space!
